# CareTag - Clothing Care Label Recognition

A full-stack web application built for the Appwrite 2025 Hacktoberfest Hackathon that uses AI to identify and explain clothing care symbols from photos.

## The Problem

Clothing tags are confusing. Most of the time they're just a bunch of symbols that don't make sense at first glance. This leads to people searching online every time they buy new clothes, which is annoying and time-consuming.

## The Solution

CareTag lets you upload a picture of your clothing tag and automatically identifies the care symbols using computer vision. It tells you what each symbol means‚Äîwhether it should be washed, ironed, dry cleaned, or not bleached. If you don't have a photo, you can also browse through all the symbols and check their meanings directly.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Material UI, Vite
- **Backend**: Appwrite (Database, Storage, Functions)
- **AI/ML**: TensorFlow Lite for image recognition
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query)
- **Routing**: React Router

## Project Structure

This is a monorepo containing both the frontend application and the Appwrite Function:

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Python 3.9+ (for the Appwrite Function)
- An Appwrite account (Cloud or self-hosted)

### Frontend Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kirstenintech/caretag.git
   cd caretag
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

   ```env
   VITE_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1
   VITE_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
   VITE_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID=your_database_id
   VITE_APPWRITE_SYMBOLS_COLLECTION_ID=your_collection_id
   VITE_APPWRITE_BUCKET_ID=your_bucket_id
   VITE_APPWRITE_FUNCTION_ID=your_function_id
   ```

4. **Start the development server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

### Appwrite Function Setup

See the [Function README](./functions/care-symbols-infer/README.md) for detailed setup instructions.

**Quick Start:**

1. Navigate to the function directory:

   ```bash
   cd functions/care-symbols-infer
   ```

2. Deploy to Appwrite:

   ```bash
   appwrite deploy function
   ```

3. Configure environment variables in Appwrite Console (see Function README for details)
